# ForecastingAI

This directory has several problems that I used a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network to address.

The first is the adding problem, taken from https://github.com/locuslab/TCN/tree/master/TCN/adding_problem

The second is trying to guess the day given a time series dominated by noise and an increasing stochastic signal.
